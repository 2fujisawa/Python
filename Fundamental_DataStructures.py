Nodes 
        - building blocks of many computer science data structures
        - Individual nodes contains data and links to other nodes
        - Each data structure adds additional constraints or behavior to these features to create the desired data structure
Node implementations
        - The data type of the data contained in the node is not specified and can be any valid Python data type ("int", "str", "float", "list", "null")
        - Link or links within the node ar esometimes referred to as pointers(because they point to another node)
        - If these links are null it means you have readhed the end of the node chain

Node Linking
        - Nodes can be linked together to a single other node forming  
        - When removed from the chain, the node is no longer accessible making it an orphan node
